# FIFO_Verilog
FIFO (First-In-First-Out) Verilog Implementation with Depth 8 and 8-bit Data  This repository contains a Verilog implementation of a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) data structure. The FIFO has a depth of 8, allowing it to store up to 8 elements of 8-bit data.  FIFOs are commonly used in digital systems to buff data between different clock domains or handle asynchronous data transfers.
